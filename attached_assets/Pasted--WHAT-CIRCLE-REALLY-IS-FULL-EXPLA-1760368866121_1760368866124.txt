🌀 WHAT “CIRCLE” REALLY IS — FULL EXPLANATION (FOR USERS)
============================================================

📱 Circle is a smart social platform that builds **communities around your interests**.  
You don’t scroll endlessly like in other apps — here, you **belong** to your kind of people.

Everything inside Circle revolves around **“Circles”** — living spaces based on topics, passions, and communities.  

============================================================
🏡 HOW CIRCLE WORKS (USER JOURNEY)
============================================================

1. 🧑 **Account Creation & Personal Behavior Tracking**  
   - When you create your account, you set your interests and profile.  
   - As you use the app — what you search, ask, and chat about — the AI silently learns what topics you like.
   - Based on this **real behavior**, AI recommends the best Circles to join.
   - Example: If someone constantly talks about **Python** in chat, AI may suggest joining:
     • “Python Developers Circle”  
     • “AI & Machine Learning Circle”  
     • “Tech Community Circle”

2. 🫂 **Join Existing Common Circles**  
   - Circle already has a set of pre-built, **official Circles**, such as:
     • AI & Tech  
     • Python Programming  
     • Arduino  
     • Fitness Goals  
     • Gamers  
     • Music Lovers  
     • Relationship Advice  
   - Anyone can join or leave these with a single tap.
   - These common circles stay on the **Home screen** for easy access.

3. 🧠 **AI Auto-Created Circles (Trend-Based)**  
   - The AI constantly listens to what people talk about across the platform.
   - If **1000+ unique users** request or talk about the same topic (e.g., “Arduino projects”), AI:
     1. Creates a **new trending Circle** automatically.
     2. Gives it a name, banner, and description.
     3. Places it on the **Home screen** as a popular topic.
   - User-created circles that don’t reach this threshold remain in the **Explore** section.

4. 🧭 **Explore Tab (User-Created Circles)**  
   - Anyone can request or create a new Circle on any topic they love.
   - These stay in the Explore tab until they trend.
   - Example:
     - “Arduino Lovers in Sri Lanka”
     - “Study Circle for Math Students”
     - “K-Pop Fans United”
   - People can browse, search, and join any community freely.

5. 💬 **Circle Chat (Group Messaging)**  
   - Inside each Circle, members can:
     • Chat in real time  
     • Share messages, images, or videos  
     • React to messages  
     • See who’s typing or online
   - AI is also part of the conversation: it **suggests relevant Circles** inside the chat itself.
     Example:
       - If you keep asking Python questions in chat, AI will say:
         👉 “You might like the **Python Developers Circle**.”

6. ✉️ **Direct Messaging (DM)**  
   - Apart from Circle group chats, users can **chat directly** with each other privately.
   - Perfect for making close friends, study partners, or team members.
   - You can view who’s online and send instant messages in real time.

7. 🧍 **Private vs Public Circles**  
   - Public Circles → Anyone can join, open communities.
   - Private Circles → Created by verified users or organizations, with admin controls.
   - Private Circles have:
     • Owners/Admins  
     • Member management  
     • Optional AI moderation rules
   - AI still monitors for spam or harmful activity.

8. 🧠 **AI Assistant — Your Guide Inside Circle**  
   - The AI isn’t just an assistant; it’s a **community brain**.  
   - It:
     • Suggests Circles based on your chat behavior  
     • Helps find like-minded people  
     • Creates trending Circles automatically  
     • Guides new users to discover what they love  
   - Think of it as your **personal guide to find your tribe**.

9. 🔔 **Notifications & Activity**  
   - Real-time notifications appear when:
     • Someone joins your Circle
     • A new message is posted
     • A trending Circle is created in your topic of interest
   - The notification bell shows unread counts and live updates.

10. 🧭 **User Profile & Recommendations**  
   - Your profile contains:
     • Avatar, bio, interests
     • Joined Circles
     • Activity history
   - AI uses this to personalize your experience more over time.
   - The more you use Circle, the **smarter it gets at understanding you.**

============================================================
🧠 AI CIRCLE CREATION LOGIC
============================================================
- 1,000+ unique users request the same topic → AI creates a new Circle.
- Auto generates:
  • Circle name
  • Description
  • Banner
  • Placement on Home screen
- Under 1,000 requests → stays in Explore.
- This prevents spam and keeps the home clean and focused on hot topics.

============================================================
🛡 WHY CIRCLE FEELS DIFFERENT
============================================================
- No random feed or endless scrolling.
- Your experience is **personalized** by AI, not algorithms trying to trap your time.
- The **most loved topics rise naturally**, created by the community’s voice.
- You don’t waste time searching — the **right Circles find you**.
