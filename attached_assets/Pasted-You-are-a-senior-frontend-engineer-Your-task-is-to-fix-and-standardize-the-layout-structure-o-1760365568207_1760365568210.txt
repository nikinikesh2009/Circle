You are a senior frontend engineer.  
Your task is to **fix and standardize the layout structure** of my Circle PWA to ensure a consistent UI across all pages.

============================================================
📌 CURRENT ISSUE
- The bottom navigation bar shows different labels on different pages (“Explore” vs “Discover”).
- The content area shifts vertically between pages.
- Dark/light theme doesn’t apply consistently across routes.
- This is caused by pages having separate layouts instead of sharing one root layout.

============================================================
🏗️ WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO

1. 🧱 **Create a single unified layout component** (e.g., `Layout.jsx`) that:
   - Contains the top navigation bar.
   - Wraps the main content container.
   - Contains the bottom navigation bar.
   - Handles dark/light theme globally.

2. 🔁 **Wrap all routes inside this unified layout** so:
   - Home
   - Explore (previously Discover)
   - Chat
   - Profile
   …all share the same structure.

3. 🧭 **Standardize the bottom navigation bar**:
   - Final tab labels should be:
     - Home
     - Explore
     - Chat
     - Profile
   - Highlight active tab properly.
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness is preserved.

4. 🎨 **Fix global styling**:
   - Use consistent padding/margin for the main content area across all pages.
   - Apply `min-h-screen` and proper flex layout so the bottom nav doesn’t jump.
   - Make theme (dark/light) apply at the root level, not per page.

5. 🧰 **Clean up theme switching**:
   - Ensure toggling between dark/light mode updates all pages instantly.
   - No white flashes or unstyled sections.

============================================================
🎯 FINAL RESULT EXPECTATION
- All pages use one unified layout.
- No vertical shifting when switching tabs.
- Navigation labels are the same everywhere.
- Dark/light theme works consistently.
- Production-grade mobile responsive structure.

============================================================
🚀 Extra (if time allows)
- Smooth transition between routes (fade or slide).
- Keep the bottom nav fixed at the bottom even when scrolling.
