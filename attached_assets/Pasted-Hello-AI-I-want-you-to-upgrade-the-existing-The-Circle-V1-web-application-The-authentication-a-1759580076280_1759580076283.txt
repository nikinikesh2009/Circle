Hello AI, I want you to **upgrade the existing The Circle V1 web application**. The authentication and MVP wall feed are already done. Your goal is to **make the app professional, usable, and visually appealing**, with foundational navigation and UI improvements. Use **Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS**. Keep code clean, modular, and error-free.

---

## 1️⃣ Navigation & Layout
- Add **top navbar or sidebar** with links: Home (Wall), Profile, Logout
- Highlight the active page
- Make navbar responsive and collapsible on mobile
- Reorganize Dashboard/Wall layout: center the feed, use **card-style posts** with proper spacing and shadows
- Ensure all pages are connected and navigation works

---

## 2️⃣ UI/UX & Dark Mode
- Apply dark mode styling consistently
- Smooth hover and click effects for buttons
- Use readable fonts, consistent spacing, and padding
- Add subtle animations to posts or streak updates
- Make the wall feed visually appealing with cards

---

## 3️⃣ Streaks & Gamification
- Display **streak counter prominently** on the dashboard
- Update streak counter visually when "Mark Motivation as Done" is clicked
- Optional: small animation/confetti when streak milestone reached

---

## 4️⃣ Profile Page
- Show user info: email and streak
- Add **update password functionality**
- Optional: avatar upload placeholder

---

## 5️⃣ Community MVP (Optional)
- Display list of active users (names only)
- Optional: sort by streak or points (for future V2)
- Ensure minimal layout integration with dashboard

---

## 6️⃣ Backend / Firebase
- Connect streak updates to Firebase database
- Ensure all data changes reflect instantly in UI
- Maintain Firebase security rules (auth read/write)

---

## 7️⃣ Deployment
- Make sure project is **deploy-ready on Replit**
- Include updated package.json and dependencies
- Keep README.md updated with setup instructions
